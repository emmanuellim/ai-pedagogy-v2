# ai-pedagogy-v2
The goal of this project is to make theories and practices related to Large Language Models (LLM) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) more accessible to the general public by using an AI Pedagogy approach.  Using analogies from human intelligence context, AI Pedagogy transfers knowledge from human-orientation to algorithmic orientation.
